      So if we talk about MF nomenclature in this example then:<br/>
      - The homepage is the remote<br/>
      - The PDP page is the host<br/>

      Which means that the PDP page is hosting the  header that is remote to it. <br/>And it's remoted in essentially, from the homepage,
    <br/> <br/>
    
    </div>
  );
}
